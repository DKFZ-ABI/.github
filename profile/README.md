# DKFZ Applied Bioinformatics (DKFZ-ABI)

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the Applied Bioinformatics group at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg.

We develop and maintain computational solutions for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput biological data, supporting interdisciplinary research in cancer and biomedical science. For more information about our group, visit our [website](https://www.dkfz.de/en/applied-bioinformatics).
